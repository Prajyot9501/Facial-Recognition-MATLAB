# Facial-Recognition-MATLAB 

This is a mini-project in MATLAB which involves the use of AlexNet for recognizing different faces from the feed from the webcam of the laptop. It involves:
- Running a script to capture facial data
- Training the AlexNet model on our captured data
- Testing the model and checking if it is correctly predicting and labelling the faces.

Here are some of the screenshots from the project.

2. Testing the model (for my face and my friend's):

As we can see in above screenshots, the model works quite well, is easy to train on a database and very accurate as well as fast when it comes to results. This project helped me understood the basic concepts behind training an AlexNet model and using it in MATLAB for further classification.
